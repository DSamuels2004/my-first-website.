<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Dallasia Samuels and I just started my last year at the University of Nevada, Reno. To help people remember my name, I tell them to think of the country "Malaysia" and replace the letter M with the letter D. It's hard to remember on it's own. 
     I'm the youngest of 6 children (I have 4 brothers and 1 sister) and I love spending time with my family. I have a 14 pound cat who is currently on a strict diet, as recommended by his veterinarian, of course.</p>

<h2>Thoughts About Post-Graduation ðŸŽ“</h2>
<p>After I graduate in May 2026, Iâ€™m not entirely sure what to do. Itâ€™s hard to imagine what life will be like in the next 6 months so I canâ€™t even imagine a year from now. Just being realâ€¦
    All I know is Iâ€™ll be the first woman to graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in my family. Iâ€™m open to different opportunities and possibilities. I want to work in a field that allows me to be creative and open with my writing skills. Iâ€™m also interested in marketing, public relations, and social media management.</p>
<h4>â‹†â­’Ëš.â‹†âŠ¹â‚ŠâŸ¡â‹† I'm still very confused and anxious about life after graduation (as most students are) â‹†â­’Ëš.â‹†âŠ¹â‚ŠâŸ¡â‹†</h4>
<p>Anyways, here are some of my favorite foods to help you get to know me better!</p>
